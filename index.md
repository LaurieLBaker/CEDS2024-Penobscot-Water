## Team

During the Spring of 2024, Cedar Callaghan ’25, Linnea Goh ’25, and Ludwin Moran Sosa ’24 worked on creating the Field and Lab reports.

## Data

Initial iterations of these reports were created using data from 2018. Access the project on [github](https://github.com/LaurieLBaker/CEDS2024-Penobscot-Water) and find out more about the data in the [codebook](https://github.com/LaurieLBaker/CEDS2024-Penobscot-Water/tree/main/data).
